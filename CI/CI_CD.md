# Techcrush Static Website CI/CD Deployment 
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project automates the deployment of a static website in AWS using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.
The pipeline provisions cloud infrastructure, deploys web content, and ensures updates are continuously delivered without manual intervention at every git push instance.

# Key Technologies Used:

AWS EC2, VPC, Subnet, Security Groups

Bash scripting (Automation)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD Pipeline)

Ubuntu 22.04 Server

HTML5 / CSS3 (Responsive Web Design)

After successful deployment, I access my live site via the EC2 public IP:

[http://<your-public-ip>](http://98.93.75.77/index.html)
[http://<your-public-ip>](http://98.93.75.77/aboutus.html
[http://<your-public-ip>](http://98.93.75.77/contact.html
